**Steps to run the code**
Here are the steps you can provide for users to run the code from your GitHub repository:

**1. Clone the Repository:**

Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone <repository_url.git>

**2. Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Use the cd command to move into the project directory.

cd <project_directory>

**3. Set Up the Environment:**
#Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies (optional but recommended).

python -m venv env

**4. Activate the virtual environment.**

Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

**5. Install Required Packages:**
Use pip to install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Model and Tokenizer:
Users need to have the pre-trained model, tokenizer, and other necessary files. Ensure they are included in your repository or specify instructions on where to download them from.

**6. Run the Streamlit App:**
Execute the Streamlit app script.

streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your main Python script containing the Streamlit code if it's named differently.

Access the App:
Once the Streamlit app is running, it should provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Open this URL in a web browser to access the Twitter sentiment analysis tool.
